## 4\. Optional Quizzes
1. #### Taking the Quiz
In order for the user to be able to attempt the optional quizzes relating to the learning material, the user has to click on the optional quiz bar located at the end of every page. A panel is then toggled to open, and the user is presented with multiple-choice style questions. 

2. #### Answering the Questions
To choose an answer from the multiple-choice style questions, the user easily clicks on the left button beside the answer that they think it's correct.
