# FromNothingToNeuralNetworks

This project is initially for Deep learning enthusiasts specifically in Convolutional Neural Networks. 
This 3rd year project is developed to give me & my partner a **deeper understanding** of how Convolutional Neural Networks work along with the 
concepts behind it.

## Along with this, there is a user manual presented to show a quick demo (snapshots) of how the project looks and works.
